                "para": "Āśramavāsika Parva or the 'Book of the Hermitage', is the fifteenth of the eighteen books of the Indian epic Mahabharata which has 47 chapters in the critical edition of BORI. The current version follows Samsadhini’s latest tagging guidelines which includes कारकसम्बन्धः (kāraka relations) सन्धि-विच्छेदः (sandhi-split) and पद-विश्लेषिका (morph analyser)."

                "para": "The parva recounts Yudhishthira's reign as king during the Pandavas' 15-year rule. Despite prior unfortunate events, the Pandavas, in exception of Bhima met with Dhritarashtra frequently, showed him the highest respect, and obeyed his directives regarding matters of governance. Even Kunti was respectful to Gandhari and served her with the utmost courtesy. The parva then recites the next two years when Dhritarashtra and Gandhari take sannyasa and live in hermitage in a jungle."
            },
            {
                "para": "The parva registers an interesting junction of duty and emotions, remorse and resentment, post- war trauma and human relations. This parva partakes of what Mahabharata aspires to be, a sketch of human life in its totality and yet in contradictions."
